## <img src="https://github.com/sudnyeshtalekar/sudnyeshtalekar/raw/master/Assets/Hi.gif" style="width:30px;height:30px"> Hi there, I'm Grace Castañeda (over45Codes)💜 🇲🇽 💻

👋 Self-taught developer on a mission to reinvent myself through code. No shortcuts. Just code, coffee, and comeback energy. 



Tech has always fascinated me. Whether it's diving into a new coding concept, improving internal processes, exploring financial tools, or traveling to new countries—I'm driven by curiosity and a hunger to grow. Every experience fuels my desire to evolve personally and professionally.
After a major life reset, I moved to Mexico and began a new chapter. In late 2020, at 46, I started teaching myself web development while working full-time. I’ve been building ever since — one commit at a time.

🧠 I believe in consistent progress, clean code, and the power of second chances.

- My mission:
To blend leadership, technical know-how, and a deep commitment to customer success in order to build smart, scalable solutions that create real impact—for both businesses and their customers.

- My driving force: Growth
Continuous learning and improvement aren’t just goals—they’re how I live and work.

- 🔍 What's on the Horizon: 
I'm eagerly looking forward to taking on exciting new challenges, which will see me delving into Ruby on Rails, HAML, SASS, SQL, and APIs. Each project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and create something extraordinary.

With over 10 years of experience in Customer and Technical Support, I’ve developed deep expertise in Contact Center operations and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) across LATAM. I’ve played a key role in supporting startups with international expansion, building bridges between customers, teams, and technology.

My enthusiasm for web development and technology pushes me to continuously level up my skills. In my current role, I collaborate with software development teams to enhance user experience and post-deployment performance—ensuring systems run smoothly and customers stay happy.

Currently, I’m focused on expanding my backend development knowledge, working with Ruby on Rails, HAML, and SQL. I thrive on solving real-world problems with practical tech solutions, driving both efficiency and innovation.


**Technical Toolbox:**
- 🌐 Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- 🔧 Backend: Ongoing training in Ruby on Rails (on my path to mastery!)
- 📚 Ongoing Learning: Constantly expanding my knowledge with new courses and projects 
- ✒︎ Git · GitHub · VSCODE · GitLab 


**Core Skills:**
Web Development · Customer Success Management · BPO Strategy · Project Management
Software Troubleshooting · Root Cause Analysis · Help Desk Support
Team Leadership · Workforce Management · Recruiting
Sales & Marketing Strategy · Tech Enthusiast
