##  👋 Hi there, I'm Grace Castañeda (over45Codes)💜 🇲🇽 💻 

### 🚀 My Late-Starter Coding Journey | #CodingInMy40s

Hey there! 👋 I’m on an exciting journey, proving that it’s never too late to transition into tech.

🛤️ My Path to Code
My coding adventure began in late 2020 when I was 46 years old. Juggling a full-time job while learning to code remotely, I’ve been diving deep into web development, sharpening my skills in:

- 🌐 Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- 🔧 Backend: Ruby on Rails (on my path to mastery!)
- 📚 Ongoing Learning: Constantly expanding my knowledge with new courses and projects

## 🌟 Why I Code
Tech has always fascinated me, and I’m passionate about problem-solving, creativity, and continuous learning. My goal? A full-time career in tech!

## 🚀 What’s Next?
Leveling up in JavaScript & Ruby on Rails
Building real-world projects
Connecting with fellow learners & developers

📌 Follow my journey as I document my progress and share insights from my self-taught experience! Let’s connect and grow together.

✨ The road may be long, but the destination is worth it! ✨

- 🌱 Throughout my journey, I have developed projects utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, I am advancing through JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails Path, alongside enrolling in supplementary coding courses. 
- 🔍 What's on the Horizon: 
I'm eagerly looking forward to taking on exciting new challenges, which will see me delving into Ruby on Rails, HAML, SASS, SQL, and APIs. Each project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and create something extraordinary.

- 💖 Personal Passions: 
I enjoy learning new things and traveling. Whether it's discovering a new coding concept or exploring a new destination, I'm all in. These experiences bring a special kind of magic to life.

- #1 Driving Force:
My driving force is growth. I wholeheartedly embrace the path of continuous learning and relentless improvement. It's not just a journey; it's a way of life.
