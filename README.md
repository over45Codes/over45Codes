Software Engineer Self-Taught Journey 👩🏻‍💻 🇲🇽 | Late bloomer in programming <br> 🌱 "Growth is a Winding Path, not a Straight Line"...
<br>
</p>


About me...
- 🌱 I embarked on my coding journey in late 2020 at the age of 46. During that period, I held a full-time job while working remotely. Throughout my journey, I have developed projects utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, I am advancing through The Odin Project Foundations with the Ruby on Rails Path, alongside enrolling in supplementary coding courses. 
- 🔭 I am eagerly anticipating upcoming project challenges that involve working with Ruby on Rails, HAML, SASS, SQL, and APIs. 
- 💖  Favorite thing to do: Learning new things + ✈️ Traveling ✨ 
- #1 Driving Force is: Growth "I embrace the road of constant learning and relentless improvement"
- 🌱 Soon start my Vtuber channel and streaming via Twitch coming this 2024...
