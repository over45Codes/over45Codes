About me...
✍️
<br>
<br>

Hello there! My coding journey kicked off in late 2020 when I was 46 years old. Balancing a full-time job with remote coding, I've been on a fascinating voyage into the world of web development. My toolkit includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on mastering JavaScript and the Ruby on Rails Path. I'm not stopping there; I'm continually enhancing my skills by enrolling in additional coding courses.
- 🌱 Throughout my journey, I have developed projects utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, I am advancing through JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails Path, alongside enrolling in supplementary coding courses. 

- 🔍 What's on the Horizon: 
I'm eagerly looking forward to taking on exciting new challenges, which will see me delving into Ruby on Rails, HAML, SASS, SQL, and APIs. Each project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and create something extraordinary.

- 💖 Personal Passions: 
My two greatest passions are learning new things and traveling. Whether it's discovering a new coding concept or exploring a new destination, I'm all in. These experiences bring a special kind of magic to life.

- #1 Driving Force:
My driving force is growth. I wholeheartedly embrace the path of continuous learning and relentless improvement. It's not just a journey; it's a way of life. Growth "I embrace the road of constant learning and relentless improvement"

🌱 What's Next: 
In the near future, I want to share my coding journey on social media! Stay tuned for exciting content and discussions on coding, technology, and more!
